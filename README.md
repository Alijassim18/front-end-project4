<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This system is designed to give users greater control over exam management by supporting three types of users: Admin, Student, and Supervisor. Supervisors can create and delete both Admin and Student accounts, while Students can take multiple exams and view their results. Admins have the ability to create, update, and delete exams. The main goal of the project is to streamline exam management and enhance user interaction throughout the entire exam process.
